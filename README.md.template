## 🧰 Clusters, Systems & Experimental Infra

### 🦷 [**GoldenTooth**](https://github.com/goldentooth)
A chaos zoo of DevOps/MLOps infrastructure: Kubernetes, Slurm, Nomad, Vault, HAProxy, and more — all deployed on a bramble of Raspberry Pis.
Use case: failure injection, distributed systems, observability, emergent behavior.

### 🌉 [**Bitterbridge**](https://github.com/bitterbridge)
A bridge between real-world engineering and speculative tinkering.
Reusable IaC, GitHub Actions, ML experiments, and Rust-based tooling.

> _“Professional polish meets unfinished philosophy.”_
