### Sup 👋
- 💻 Software/DevOps Engineer, more of a generalist, always looking to get more time to expand my knowledge and strengthen my skillset 😃
- 🏥 Working for [Agile Six](https://agile6.com/) on the [VA.gov Modernization](https://www.va.gov/modernization/) initiative, improving care and accessibility to resources for veterans of the United States military.
- 🌱 Currently learning:
  - ☸️ Kubernetes
  - 🦑 ArgoCD
  - 💧 Drupal (six years in and still don't know as much as I probably should)
  - 🔥 Prometheus
  - 📜 Loki
  - ⚛️ React
  - ... and too many other things to mention.

- 🎲 In my infinitesimal free time, I like:
  - 🧱 building LEGO stuff with my [kid](https://github.com/JomoDuggins)
  - 🎸 playing various musical instruments, chiefly bass guitar, drums, accordion, but the set expands and contracts pretty frequently
  - ☁️ working on my [homelab](https://github.com/hellholt/), which never manages to develop quite as fast as my ideas
  - 🏋️‍♂️ lifting weights, building strength
  - 🏃‍♂️ getting back into running, which currently is mostly physical therapy for my knees
  - 📚 reading (currently re-reading _A Song of Ice and Fire_: _A Storm of Swords_).
- 💡 Thinking about (although never actually working on):
  - 🗡️ a [roguelike game in Rust](https://github.com/ndouglas/azymus) based around artificial intelligence and observability of NPCs
  - 📖 books about strange apocalypses
  - 🐠 automating my aquaria
  - 🥞 cooking, beyond some rudimentary stuff
  - 📻 listening to my ever-growing backlog of podcasts
